Deep Learning on 3D data for mobile robot semantic SLAM. 

You will generate your own (synthetic) train data set for 3D Data (eg. PCL data) and try to detect common intralogistic objects (pallets, person, boxes, etcâ€¦ ) in the sensor stream of a mobile robot. Related topics are: Deep Learning on 3D PCL data, PointNet++ architecture (just as an idea, of course you can come up with your own net architecture), Synthetic Train Data generation and Evaluation in Sim and real world.
